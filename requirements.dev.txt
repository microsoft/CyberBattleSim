### type stubs
numpy_stubs @ git+https://github.com/numpy/numpy-stubs/@master#egg=numpy_stubs


# Unfortunately, the official `data-science-types` package overwrites
# the numpy stubs above, and their stubs are not as reliable.
# So we use instead one of the project fork that disables the numpy stubs
# See https://github.com/predictive-analytics-lab/data-science-types/issues/132
# and https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/issues/861
#data-science-types~=0.2.20
